Dear Wambui,

Thank you for choosing Little Kidogo to help you develop your product. We are excited to work with you and your team and honored to have the opportunity of helping your business grow towards an even more successful future!

In order to achieve this goal, we are kicking off the project with the 5-day Product Design Sprint, a process advertised by Google Ventures. 

To better understand how we can work together to create a successful product please see below for the process we will be following during the Product Design sprint:

 A list of websites similar to parts of what we want to create, as well as other websites with aspects we may wish to emulate.
 Information about each of your key customer types: who they are, their stories, and how they feel about the problem we are working to solve. *If there's documentation from interviews you conducted with them, we'd love to see that too!
Any existing materials you already have on hand, such as user stories, wireframes, or prototypes. No need to flesh these out more than you already have, but they'd be a great background. *Note that what we end up with at the end of the sprint may be different.
Please also gather any other background materials you already have.
For Day 5: We'll want to schedule time with users in the morning and early afternoon, 6 users for 30 minutes each would be ideal. Then to finish off day 5 we'll want to finish by 2:30 pm to prepare findings for a 3:30 pm discussion that day that will end the Design Sprint. *This is where we'll have each participant use the prototype we built and ask them questions to get their feedback.
As the above steps explained, in order to run the Design Sprint, we would need to schedule 5 days for the activities involved. 

In this time period, our team at Little Kidogo will work with the key stakeholders who form part of your product's unique value proposition. We will also source and provide subject experts for various aspects of your solution. 

As per Day 5's procedures,  please think of a number of personas such as potential users, current actors in the problem faced, or basically anyone that has a personal need for the solution your product holds as the 6 users to schedule time with to test the prototype. If you identify the people you want to bring in, we'd be happy to schedule them, or you could schedule the times directly if that's easier.

In terms of scheduling your Product Design Sprint - we are happy to start on Monday the 22nd of October 2018 - if this week would be fitting for you?

Then, lastly, here's a form with which you can help us gather the information we need to prepare the sprint for your fundraising solution (If you could please fill it out as you feel fit), thank you.

Looking forward to hearing from you.



Kind regards



The Little Kidogo Team
